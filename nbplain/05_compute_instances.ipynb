    "### Choosing the right instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure offers a range of virtual machines (VMs) optimized for both CPU and GPU-intensive workloads. Choosing the correct compute instance and partition will depend primarily on your specific scientific research requirements such as workload you are running, and will depend on cost, runtime and whether an interruption is acceptable (more on that in spot vs pay-as-you-go). \n",
    "\n",
    "The instance types currently available in Nimbus:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High performance compute**: hbv2, hbv3 & hc series\n",
    "- **GPU enabled**: ncv3, ncv3r, & ndv2\n",
    "- **Compute Optimised**: fsv2\n",
    "\n",
    "The descriptions of the instances provided by Azure are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Performance Compute**: `Our fastest and most powerful CPU virtual machines with optional high-throughput network interfaces (RDMA).`\n",
    "- **GPU enabled**: `Specialized virtual machines targeted for heavy graphic rendering and video editing, as well as model training and inferencing (ND) with deep learning. Available with single or multiple GPUs.`\n",
    "- **Compute Optimised**: `High CPU-to-memory ratio. Good for medium traffic web servers, network appliances, batch processes, and application servers.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly:\n",
    "- The `hb*` instances are suggested for applications driven by memory bandwidth such as OpenFOAM and ANSYS.\n",
    "- The `hc*` & `f*` instances are suggested for applications driven by compute such as HPL and ORCA.\n",
    "- The `n*` partitions are for GPU accelerated workloads and visualization sessions.\n",

    "Spot pricing allows access to unused Azure compute capacity at large discounts, up to 90%, compared to Pay-As-You-Go prices. The drawback is that the job can be interrupted at any time and be evicted, depending on the available Azure capacity.\n",

These are RDMA connected, and you cannot run single jobs across multiple nodes, hence the restriction.\n",
