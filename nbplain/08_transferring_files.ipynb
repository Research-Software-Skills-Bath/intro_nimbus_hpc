    "## Transferring files\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing with a remote computer offers very limited use if we cannot get files to or from the cluster. There are several options for transferring data between computing resources, from command line options to GUI programs, which we will cover here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Download files from the internet using wget\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most straightforward ways to download files is to use wget. Any file that can be downloaded in your web browser with an accessible link can be downloaded using wget. This is a quick way to download datasets or source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is: wget https://some/link/to/a/file.tar.gz. For example, download an example file with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "nimbus-user: wget https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest-ssl&os=linux64&lang=en-US -O firefox.tar.bz2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Chek the file was indeed downloaded: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "nimbus-user:$ls\n",
    "firefox.tar.bz2 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And then lets clean it up:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "nimbus-user:$ rm firefox.tar.bz2 \n",

    "## Transferring single files and folders with scp\n",
    "\n",
    "To copy a single file to or from the cluster, we can use `scp`. The syntax can be a little complex for new users, but we’ll break it down here:\n",
    "\n",
    "To transfer to another computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "user@laptop:~$ scp /path/to/local/file.txt userid@nimbus.hpc.bath.ac.uk:/path/on/remote/computer\n",

    "user@laptop:~$ scp userid@nimbus.hpc.bath.ac.uk:/path/on/remote/computer/file.txt /path/to/local/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can simplify doing this by shortening our paths. On the remote computer, everything after the : is relative to our home directory. We can simply just add a : and leave it at that if we don’t care where the file goes.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "user@laptop:~$ scp local-file.txt userid@nimbus.hpc.bath.ac.uk:\n",

    "## rsync \n",
    "\n",
    "As you gain experience with transferring files, you may find the scp command limiting. The rsync utility provides advanced features for file transfer and is typically faster compared to both scp and sftp (see below). It is especially useful for transferring large and/or many files and creating synced backup folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is similar to scp. To transfer to another computer with commonly used options:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "[local]$ rsync -avzP /path/to/local/file.txt userid@nimbus.hpc.bath.ac.uk:/path/on/remote/computer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The a (archive) option preserves file timestamps and permissions among other things; the v (verbose) option gives verbose output to help monitor the transfer; the z (compression) option compresses the file during transit to reduce size and transfer time; and the P (partial/progress) option preserves partially transferred files in case of an interruption and also displays the progress of the transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recursively copy a directory, we can use the same options:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "[local]$ rsync -avzP /path/to/local/dir userid@nimbus.hpc.bath.ac.uk:/path/on/remote/computer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The a (archive) option implies recursion.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "[local]$ rsync -avzP userid@nimbus.hpc.bath.ac.uk:/path/on/remote/computer/file.txt /path/to/local/\n",
