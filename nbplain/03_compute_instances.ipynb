    "\n",
    "- **High Performance Compute**: `Our fastest and most powerful CPU virtual machines with optional high-throughput network interfaces (RDMA).`\n",
    "- **GPU enabled**: `Specialized virtual machines targeted for heavy graphic rendering and video editing, as well as model training and inferencing (ND) with deep learning. Available with single or multiple GPUs.`\n",
    "- **Compute Optimised**: `High CPU-to-memory ratio. Good for medium traffic web servers, network appliances, batch processes, and application servers.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly:\n",
    "- The `hb*` instances are suggested for applications driven by memory bandwidth such as OpenFOAM and ANSYS.\n",

These are RDMA connected, and you cannot run single jobs across multiple nodes, hence the restriction.\n",
